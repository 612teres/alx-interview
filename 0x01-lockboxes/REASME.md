# Lockboxes Problem

## Overview
The program determines whether all boxes in a sequence can be unlocked. Each box contains keys to other boxes, and the goal is to check if all boxes can be opened starting from the first box (box 0).

## Files
- `0-lockboxes.py`: Contains the implementation of the `canUnlockAll` function.
- `main_0.py`: Script to test the `canUnlockAll` function.
- `README.md`: Documentation of the project.

## Usage
Make sure all files are executable:

```bash
chmod +x 0-lockboxes.py main_0.py
